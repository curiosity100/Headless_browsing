# Headless_browsing
A headless browser is a web browser with no user interface (UI) whatsoever. Instead, it follows instructions defined by software developers in different programming languages. Headless browsers are mostly used for running automated quality assurance tests, or to scrape websites.

Headless Browser Testing, in general, means an object/ thing with no head, and in context to browsers, it means browser simulation, which has no UI. Headless browser automation uses a web browser for end-to-end testing without loading the browser's UI
